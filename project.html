        <h1> About Me </h1>
        <p> My name is William Alerding, I am 16 and a half years old. My birthday is on june 17th. I am a student at Riley High School. I deeply enjoy space and find most of its attributes to be intruiging and I enjoy hearing about our discoveries of our solar system and beyond. Neil De Grasse Tyson is one of my role models, simply because of what he knows and the way he thinks. Neil has showed me a different way of thinking and has made me even more curious about space than I have ever before. My absolute favorite breed of dogs is the pug. They are the absolute cutest thing to me. I love their smooshed faces and little squiggly tails. My hobbies consist of video games and learning new things, especially if its physics related. I absolutely love super-heros. Im a pretty big nerd, I enjoy comic books and action packed stories. </p>

        <h1> About This Class </h1>
        <p> I am currently in Ms. Haubolds computer science class. I deeply enjoy this class and its taught me a lot. I have learned so much about the basics of coding, python, and now html. I find it very interesting to make websites because I can make almost anything out of nothing. Ms. Haubold has been an amazing help and a great teacher. I wouldnt be anywhere close to what I know now without her :) ! I also wouldnt be able to make this website right now without her. Besides my teacher, my peers have also taught me a lot. From a basic website to making a small mini game in scratch. I will be sad for this class to be over, but I will most certainly use what ive learned in my near future.
